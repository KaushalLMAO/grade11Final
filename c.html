        <p>
          To communicate with the computer is to develop a third language- a
          language that can be understood by both you and the computer. This is
          what a programming language is, A set of rules that provides a way of
          instructing the computer to perform certain operations. A computer
          needs instructions to follow because it cannot think on its own. For
          instance, when playing a game of solitare you must chose which card to
          move. These instructions compose only a small part of the solitare
          program. This program comprises many more instructions that allow a
          user to perform actions, such as begnining or ending a game,
          seleecting card's color, and so forth. Therefore, a computer program
          comprises instructions that direct the actions of the computer.

          A computer program is a sequence of instruction written using a
          computer programming language to perform a specified task by the
          computer. A computer program is also called a computer software, which
          can range from two lines to millions of lines of instructions.

        <p>
            A low level language is a programming language that deals with a computer's hardware components and constraints. Low level languages are designed to operate and handle the entire hardware and instructions set architecture of a computer directly. A low level language may also be referred to as a computer's native language.

        <h3>Machine Language</h3>
        <p>The first generation programming language are also called low level programming language because they were used to program the computer system at a very low level of abstraction. Machine language is the lowest and most elementary level of programming language and was the first type of programming language to be developed.
            Machine level language is the only language that computer can understand. In machine level language the programmer only deals with two numbers, 0 and 1.
